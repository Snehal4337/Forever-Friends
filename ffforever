In friendship's embrace, hearts entwine,
A bond of trust, forever aligned.
Through laughter and tears, we find our way,
In each other's company, come what may.
Through storms and sun, hand in hand we stride,
A friendship's warmth, forever our guide.
In laughter and tears, we find our grace,
Forever companions, hearts intertwined in this space.
